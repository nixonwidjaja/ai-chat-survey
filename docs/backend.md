# Backend Report

## Section Introduction
This section serves as a comprehensive exploration of the backend infrastructure underpinning our AI chatbot survey system. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the LLM (Large Language Model) at the heart of our solution, along with a detailed examination of the backend architecture. Through this report, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of our model selection rationale, its integration into the survey framework, and the overarching architecture supporting its functionality. Furthermore, we discuss our approach to model evaluation, post-deployment tracking, and strategies for continuous improvement.

## Literature Review
- Insert literature review regarding traditional surveys as well as efforts to 
integrate LLMs into surveys

## Backend Architecture
### 1. Introduction to Backend Architecture

Brief overview of the purpose and importance of the backend architecture in supporting the AI chatbot survey system.

### 2. Components of the Backend Architecture

#### a. Server

Description of the backend server responsible for handling requests and processing data.

#### b. Database

Explanation of the data storage solution used for persisting survey data, user information, etc.

#### c. API

Overview of the interface through which the frontend communicates with the backend.
- [API](api.md)

#### d. Authentication/Authorization

Explanation of components responsible for user authentication and authorization.

### e. Interactions between Components

Description of how the different components interact with each other. Illustration of the flow of data and interactions between components using diagrams if necessary.

### 4. Technology Stack

List of technologies and frameworks used for each component. Justification for the choice of each technology based on factors like scalability, performance, etc.

### 5. Scalability and Performance Considerations

Discussion on how the architecture is designed to handle scalability and ensure optimal performance. Explanation of strategies such as horizontal scaling, caching mechanisms, and load balancing.

### 6. Justification for Models/Solution Chosen

Tie-back to user interviews conducted by the frontend team to justify the choice of models and solutions in the backend architecture. Explanation of how the architecture aligns with user requirements and expectations gathered from user feedback.
  
## Model Evaluation

  - In-depth study of performance of model and it's failings.
  - Interpretation of model

## Post-Deployment Tracking and Improvement
- Insert model evaluation
- Rubrics:
   - Demonstrate an awareness of how model can be tracked and improved after
     deployment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this backend report has provided a detailed examination of the infrastructure supporting our AI chatbot survey system. We have explored the core components, including the LLM model, and discussed the rationale behind our model selection and its integration into the survey framework. Additionally, we have examined the backend architecture, shedding light on the design decisions and the system's functionality. Through thorough model evaluation and post-deployment tracking, we have gained insights into the performance of our solution and identified avenues for improvement.
